### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The foundation of any agile development project is the usage of user stories, which depict the product vision through a collection of "stories" that describe the requirements and expectations of the target audience. Then, testers can check to see if the predicted outputs and inputs match.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
