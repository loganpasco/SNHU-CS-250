## Software Development Lifecycle Course
### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The foundation of any agile development project is the usage of user stories, which depict the product vision through a collection of "stories" that describe the requirements and expectations of the target audience. Then, testers can check to see if the predicted outputs and inputs match.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Instead of doing extensive upfront planning that can fail and create issues, I'd like to test the idea of planning lightly and developing a working product that I can then test and conduct a series of evolving releases.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It seems that there are many risks and issues in software development that can be quite difficult to resolve, but like with most teams, it seems that patience and communication are key. Respect must also be shown to all those involved in the process. A good team member would also be dedicated to continuous growth, willing to participate in scrum meetings and learn from teammates. You must also realize that it is impossible to know the precise right answer to a question in advance, and even if you do, there may still be additional correct answers.
